### Project Requirements

**Build a to-do list app.**

- As a user of this app, you should be able to create to-do items which you can then mark as complete (or incomplete). You should also be able to edit these items, as well as delete them.

  - User should be able to sign up an account.
  - User should be able to log in and out of the app.
  - User should be able to view their to-do list.
  - User should be able to create a to-do item.
